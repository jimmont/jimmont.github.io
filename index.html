<h2>general approach</h2>
<p>Continuous improvement with respect and appreciation for the individuals composing the team and community. Working together we accomplish more than apart. We are a composite of the intersections of and with others, realizing opportunities by focusing on and finding solutions. More detail at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way">The Toyota Way</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a>.</p>
<p>When it's necessary to communicate being direct, considerate, explicit and parsimonious is generally clearer and more effective than implying and other indirect patterns (meta-programming like proxies, bare modules). This is applicable to communication in any language and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA">Ryan Dahl's comments</a>, science education and life experience inform this thinking.</p>
<h2>browser strategy</h2>
<p>Target modern browsers mobile through desktop, and transpile a 2nd variant for the legacy clients. Polyfill for modern when features are in active use and doing so brings parity at low cost. This provides a low overhead, cost-effective forward looking solution while maintaining a distinct cost-controlled view for the remaining audience. For larger projects and organizations higher predictability and stability can be gained with something like TypeScript, however there's a cost associated in the tradeoff. Web APIs are becoming more stable and consistent, solving problems that numerous libraries did previously. This allows reducing external dependencies and all the risk and overhead these bring to a project (actual native solutions: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl">Intl</a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">Web Components</a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables/properties</a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">svg</a>,
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">etc</a>). The Polymer project progression into <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/">LitElement</a> reflects this approach of movement from sensible patterns toward native implemenation over time, mixing relevant concerns in the natural course of work.
</p>
<h2>branching</h2>
<p>Generally master - bugfix - develop - features with tagging for releases. Work off develop and features by default. Master and bugfix are coordinated by a core infrastructure with predictable handling of the flow from develop toward master.</p>
<h2>release</h2>
<p>Always maintain one or more rollback options for fault tolerance and immediate recovery. Setting up an environment and deployment process where a load balancer can switch between active release candidates allows direct testing, release, rollback and iteration through these as necessary. Maintaining a balance of cache tuning with client and application features at the various layers can provide positive returns in service quality.</p>
<h2>testing</h2>
<p>A balance of unit, functional and composite end-to-end testing provides best value. Unit tests duplicate code size and must be maintained to not provide false negatives. Ideally long-lived and especially high-use code has coverage--otherwise that investment, especially initially can be better made at higher-level coverage. Functional and compositve e2e tests are increasingly expensive yet provide very high value. Imagine customers cannot login to the product or a sales person cannot make a presentation. Being able to auto-play these scenarios by anyone in the organization, including for sales presentations, is of high value to the business.</p>
<h2>API development</h2>
<p>A recurring problem on the FrontEnd has to do with how to represent an unavailable API. There are essentially 2 effective approaches I've seen (and a 3rd ineffective one, stub manually). One is to record or produce fake responses in HAR file format (for example from a devtools network panel export) and then replay this traffic from the static file. The other is to create the API and have it serve static resources representing the expected responses when an option is given for the endpoints (eg <code>/api/endpoint?describe</code>). This effectively makes the API self-describing (it's in or close to the source) and is a fast way to get up and running. Add to this generic error handling including an endpoint for producing any given response (<code>/api/fake?code=204</code>, <code>/api/fake?code=200&amp;body=encoded-body</code>) and the consumers of the API can be up and running quickly. In my own experience with Expressjs setting up the general response handling for all the requests and error codes to fall through, allowing overriding status codes, etc and checking these during the fallthrough, has worked well for capturing all the scenarios. Also, always set caching headers, even if for just 1 second. Don't set them too long where there's any chance of needing to update--I think GAE defaults to 10 minutes--unless the assets have versioning built into the mix in which case just the entry point needs to caching set appropriately. Be sure to ignore no-cache and similar cache-invalidating requests unless specifically expected (ie the premise is clients cannot be trusted, trust explicitly then invalidate the rest--especially when paying for the workload).</p>
<h2>versioning</h2>
<p>major.minor.patch - major indicating backward-incompatibility; minor backward-compatible; patch fix release time naturally incrementing. Like <code>0.4.20201101082300000</code> from <code>`major.minor.(new Date()).toISOString().replace(/[^\d]/g, '')`</code>.</p>
